# Daily Set Frontend (React + Vite)

This is the new React frontend. It builds into the FastAPI static folder so the backend can serve it directly.

- Dev server: http://localhost:5173
- API proxy: /api -> http://127.0.0.1:8000, /ws -> ws://127.0.0.1:8000
- Build output: `app/static/dist`

## Scripts

- npm install
- npm run dev
- npm run build
