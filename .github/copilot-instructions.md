# Daily Set Game - Copilot Instructions

## Architecture

- `.idea/`: Contains personalized progress report for development environment (ignore).
- `.github/`: Contains GitHub workflows and Copilot instructions.
- `app/`: Contains the FastAPI backend code.
- `frontend/`: Contains the React frontend code.

## Instructions

- Ensure that all changes are consistent across the backend and frontend as needed.
- Add comments in the code to explain complex logic or decisions.
- Write tests for new features and ensure existing tests pass.
- Update documentation in `app/README.md` and `frontend/README.md` as necessary.
- Follow best practices for code quality, security, and performance.
- Check the progress report for any specific tasks or goals that need to be addressed.
- As prompted, every change and plan should be documented and updated in the `.idea/progress-report.md` file.
